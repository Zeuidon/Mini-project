Project Title:
**Document Similarity using Natural Language Processing**


**Overview of work**

The Document Similarity project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to compare the similarity between two documents in PDF format. 
The goal of this project is to provide a tool for users to determine how closely related or similar two documents are by analyzing their textual content. 
It utilizes two main approaches: TF-IDF and BERT-based embeddings, combined with cosine similarity.
